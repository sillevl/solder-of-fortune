# Learn to solder

With this kit you can learn to solder SMT components. The kit includes different PCB's that will enable you to disover new skills and give you increasingly more experience into soldering. The kit is composed of increasingly more difficult tasks. You will get better and more experienced in soldering techniques, but you will likely encounter your limits as well. You might not be able to finish each challenge, but that is ok.

The first challenge exists out of a simple PCB using only trough hole components that are easy to solder. You will create a 7-segment display, containing 4 characters totaling 32 leds. The display can then be used to validate the next challenges. You can connect each of the challenges to the display and get feedback of your soldering skills. If all goes well you will see a message indicating perfect soldering. If the message is not complete or contains nonsense, then you will need to inspect or debug the PCB.

The kit contains different challenges that will teach you to solder the different types of packages that are commonly used. The challenges get increasingly more difficult. You will need the skills and experience of the previous challenge in order to finish the next. In the end you will master enough skill and confidence to  create and rework any PCB.
